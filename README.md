**What is it?**

The Interconnected Tank System Dataset (**InTaSet**) is a comprehensive benchmark dataset for nonlinear system identification and sensor-fault detection, based on real-time measurements from a physical interconnected quadruple-tank testbed operating in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.

The main folder InTaSet.zip contains two subfolders: (1) dataset for system identification (InTaSet-ID) and (2) dataset for sensor-fault detection (InTaSet-FD).

Within the InTaSet-ID sub-folder, four testbed configurations are provided. Each configuration uses different training and testing datasets.  

Within the InTaSet-FD sub-folder, it contains 4-subsubfolders: (1) clean (closed-loop operating modes), (2) sensor-fault to Tank 1, (3) sensor-fault to Tank 3, and (4) sensor-fault to Tank 1 and 3.
